Overview
========

As GDS GDS virtual tutorial series covers a wide range of topics from data science to machine learning to artificial intelligence, physical data science problems, neural networks, APIs, and large language models.

The tutorials are 60-90-minute sessions involving an explanation of the topic and a code demonstration that attendees can follow along with.

Suggestions for topics and speaker nominations can be sent to the GDS Secretary, Julie Butler, at butlerju@mountunion.edu.

# 2025
## March 28, 2025: [Introduction to Data Science](032825_IntroToDS/README.md)
An introduction to the field of data science and data science libraries in Python. View the recording [here](https://youtu.be/pj0p_eTVjj0?si=h3KUOunClUI_n_QE).

## April 11, 2025: [Intrduction to Awk and Sed](041125_AwkAndSed/README.md)
An introduction to the command line tools awk and sed for data analysis.

## April 25, 2025: [Intrduction to complex-time (kime) representaiton and spacekime analytics](042525_Kime/README.md)
A hands-on tutorial on complex-time (kime) representation, statistical inference, and AI prediction based on repeated measurements of high-dimensional data. This space-kime analytics approach blends quantum physics, computational statistics, and AI to tackle difficult observational data forecasting problems.
