# Modern Python Tools for Reproducible Science

Reproducibility is a cornerstone of robust scientific research, yet achieving it in computational workflows can often be challenging. Recently, modern Python tools have been developed that enable reproducible workflows by default. In this seminar, we'll explore Marimo notebooks as a next-generation reactive notebook environment that is enabled, by default, inherently reproducible code execution compared to traditional Jupyter notebooks. We will also discuss "uv", a pip replacement that's ~10-100x faster.
