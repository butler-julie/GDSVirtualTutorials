This tutorial introduces two main classes of scientific machine learning (SciML) methods: Neural Ordinary/Partial Differential Equations (ODEs/PDEs) and Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs). These methods typically solve complementary problems: Neural ODEs are used to approximate an unknown differential equation from available data points in the solution space; by contrast, PINNs are used to approximate the solution to a known differential equation that is numerically challenging to solve. This tutorial will examine both approaches in the context of the same differential equation to facilitate comparisons and distinguish between use cases of each approach.

The tutorial is accessible using the Colab link at the top, or it can be run locally in an environment with the libraries listed in the `requirements.txt`.
